/*
React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our 
React app without using props.In other words, React context allows us to share data (state) across 
our components more easily.

The useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook. It allows for custom state logic.If you find 
yourself keeping track of multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic, useReducer may be 
useful. useReducer(<reducer>, <initialState>)
